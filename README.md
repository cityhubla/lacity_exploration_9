Comparing LACITY Open Data with Official Reports

* This exploration looks at data reported in the Aug 25, 2016 Quarterly Status Report of [Mayor Garcetti's Executive Directive 13, Support for Affordable Housing](http://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti%E2%80%99s-executive-directive-13-support-affordable-housing).
* The status report, addresses the Mayor's goal of permitting 100,000 new housing units by 2021 as there are not enough housing to keep up with the demand in one of the nation's most expensive metropolitan regions.
* Can open data be used to reach the numbers as reported by the Mayor's Office?
  * Open data can only go so far in analysis due to the limited information municipal goverments are willing to give in the public datasets. This may be due to an issuing department's concerns of the quality of the data, or their unawareness of the need for more detailed datasets.
  * The methods outlined here may or may not arrive to the official numbers, and documenting them here on github invites others to participate in testing out alternative ways and try other datasets that could reach a more accurate representation of the housing status in the City of Los Angeles.
  * In the end, it's not about the results but to see if citizens, academics and professionals can use open data in support of improving the quality of information published by municipal governments.
